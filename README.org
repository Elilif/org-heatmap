consistency in a visual manner. It presents an overview heatmap on Org-mode
agendas or Calendar, providing visual representation of task completions and
task statistics.

* Installation

:TOC:      0
:END:
You must also install these packages:

+  Emacs >= 28.2
+  =emacsql= >= 3.1.1
+  =org-mode= >= 9.6

ps. I have not tested in the lower versions of the mentioned packages.

Then put org-heatmap.el in your load-path, and eval:
#+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-habit
	:custom
	(org-habit-graph-column 1)
	(org-habit-preceding-days 10)
	(org-habit-following-days 1)
	(org-habit-show-habits-only-for-today nil))

  (use-package org-heatmap
	:init
	(add-to-list 'load-path "/path-to/emacsql/")
	(add-to-list 'load-path "/path-to/org-heatmap/")
	(require 'org-heatmap)
	:after (org)
	:custom
	(org-agenda-files '("/path-to/org-heatmap/examples/examples.org"))
	(org-heatmap-db-location "/path-to/org-heatmap/examples/org-heatmap.db")
	:config
	(org-heatmap-mode))

** Functions

*Note*: When you run these functions for the first time, you may experience some
lag (the lag time depends on the length of your habits record).

- =org-heatmap-habit-draw-overview=
  
  Draw an overview heatmap for the habit at point. When your cursor is on a
  habit in =org-agenda-mode=, you can call this function or press =h= to generate a
  heatmap for the habit. Call this function or press =h= again will erase the
  heatmap.

  You can hover your mouse over a rectangle, and you will see the time you spent
  on the habit on that day. Clicking the rectangle will redirect you to an
  agenda view of that day.


  *Note*: This function uses =org-heatmap-rectangle= to draw heatmap, and for
  different fonts, the display effect may vary. The font used in the screenshots
  is =Cascadia Mono=. You can choose suitable characters based on the font you are
  using.
  
- =org-heatmap-calendar=
  
  Display a three-month Gregorian calendar. Add highlights indicating the
  activities on the current calendar date.

  Whenever you complete a task (when a item is changed to DONE in org-mode.),
  the activity counter for the day will increase by one and update the database.
  You can use =org-heatmap-calendar= to generate a heatmap of your everyday
  activity, and use built-in functions such as  =org-calendar-goto-agenda= to see
  details.
  
- =org-heatmap-habit-calendar=
  
  Like =org-heatmap-calendar=, display a three-month Gregorian calendar for the
  habit at point.

  Add highlights indicating the times spent on the habit on the current calendar
  date.

  Whenever you complete a habit (when a item is changed to DONE in org-mode.),
  org-heatmap will record the time you spent on this habit today and write it to
  the database. You can use this command to generate a heatmap of your
  everyday time spent, and use built-in functions such as =org-calendar-goto-agenda=
  to see details.
  
- =org-heatmap-calendar-query=
  
  In =Calendar-mode= with org-heatmap highlights, you can use this function (bound
  to =f= in =calendar-mode=) to get information about the activities on the current calendar date.

  When used with =org-heatmap-calendar=, it shows how many items are done on the
  current calendar date.

  When used with =org-heatmap-habit-calendar=, it shows how many times is spent on
  the habit on the current calendar date.
  
- =org-heatmap-adjust=

  Change the number of done items on the current calendar date, used with
  =org-heatmap-calendar= (bound to =j= in =calendar-mdoe=).
  
  *Note* that this function is not applied to =org-heatmap-habit-calendar= for now.
- =org-heatmap-db--drop=
  
  Delete a table from org-heatmap database.
** Variables
- =org-heatmap-rectangle=
  
  Characters used to draw overview heatmap.

  When your overview heatmap is not displayed ideally, you can consider changing
  to suitable characters.

- =org-heatmap-enable-habit-statics=
  
  Whether to shoaw habit statics.

  Add three data after the habit entry: (current streak, max streak and total
  done number).

  *Note*: If you want to chage this variable, please set it before loading
  org-heatmap or use =setopt=.

- =org-heatmap-threshold=

  Choose a different face based on the threshold arrived.

- =org-heatmap-db-location=

  Default database location.
* TODOs
- [ ] Speed up database writes
- [ ] Add project management
- [ ] Record more data
- [ ] Support for more complex database operations
- [ ] Support for more data display modes
